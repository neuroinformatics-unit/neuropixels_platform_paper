# Neuropixels Platform Paper

<img src="icon.png" width="400">

This repository contains code for generating the figures in the pre-print describing the scientific findings from the Allen Institute's [Neuropixels data collection platform](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/circuits/visual-coding-neuropixels).

Most of the figures can be generated from publicly available NWB files and unit tables, available via the AllenSDK. See [the AllenSDK documentation](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/visual_coding_neuropixels.html) for an overview of the dataset and example notebooks for accessing it.

Each figure in the pre-print has a folder with associated code. Data required for figure generation that's not available in the October 2019 release (e.g., from the change detection experiments) is included in the `data` directory.

This repository is still a work in progress; we will continue to clean up the code and add documentation throughout the review process.

# Run the additional scripts
Create an environment via the environment.yml file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate neuropixels_platform_paper_test
```

Then, edit the PATH VARIABLES in the `common/paths.py` file to point to the correct directories on your machine.
If you do not have a `ecephys_cache_dir` please create one.
Then run the file to create the units table, which contains layer information for each unit:
```bash
python common/create_units_table.py
```

Now you can run `generate_figures_for_each_layer.py` to generate the figures for each layer. N.B. this script will take a long time to run the first time, as it will download the necessary data from the Allen Institute's servers. Please edit the PATH VARIABLES in the `common/paths.py` file to point to the correct directories on your machine as before.
```bash
python generate_figures_for_each_layer.py
```
